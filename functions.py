"""This package contains functions specific for usage in statistics, and
was designed for students' use in ST2334, a statistics module by the
National University of Singapore.

The package imports from three modules, SciPy, and the native statistics
and math modules.

Functions are segmented into three sections:

1   General Use
2   Confidence Intervals
3   Hypotheses Testing

Designed primarily for use in the latter two sections, it is recommended
that for computation of statistics outside of the mentioned fields, other
software such as a graphing calculator be used instead.
